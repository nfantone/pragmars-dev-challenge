> Pragmars take home development test

Communication hasn't been the same since [emoji][emoji-wp] :+1: came around in the early 2000s. It's time to acknowledge their importance by building a _mobile first_, Pragmars exclusive, _emoji database app_!

We know it's not always easy to know which _emoji_ to use in every situation :tomato:. That's why we'd love the help of a tiny web application that could tell us **which is the right emoji to use** given some descriptive **keywords**. At least [Emoji 1.0](https://emojipedia.org/emoji-1.0/) should be supported. English language would do. We are looking for the actual emoji image and its readable name (ie.: :upside_down_face: + _Upside down face_)

* :smile: It'd be handy dandy if this application could, say, **return us a big smile** if we were to write down _"smile"_ or _"happy"_ or even _"joy"_, _"content"_, _"smiling"_, _"willing"_, _"glad"_, _"pleased"_, _"delighted"_, _"merry"_!

* :christmas_tree: Perhaps it'd **show us a tall, sturdy christmas tree** if we were to reach for words like _"christmas"_, _"jolly"_, _"xmas"_, _"pine"_, _"holiday"_, _"december"_, _"noel"_ or _"yule"_. Maybe _"yuletide"_ will do, even?

* :tada: What about a **party popper**, you say? _"tada"_, _"party"_, _"popper"_, _"celebration"_, _"party hat"_!

> We only care about the _perfect_ :sparkles: emoji for any given situation! So if more than one emoji :couple: matches what we need, **pick the top one**.

* Also, it's always good to have a **random emoji** conveniently close to you for those circumstances where you are not too sure about what to say or write :thinking:. A clear, attractive button should be there to give us a different one each time we pressed it down!

* Finally, we would like to know **how many times a particular emoji has been shown to users** (any user) so any time someone uses the app and searches for a particular emoji or gets a random one, we can tell how many global hits it has had before. Keeping track of emoji popularity should be simple!

_That's all we need!_ :smirk:

How you build the solution is _entirely_ up to you now. We are going to be evaluating everything, but, _mostly_, we care about:

* :bulb: **Creativity**. Go nuts.
* :wrench: **Tools**. Choose what you feel most comfortable or skilled with.
* :man_technologist: **Good practices**! Design patterns, architecture and the nitty-gritty stuff.
* :iphone: **Mobile look and feel**. We don't care if it's pretty as long as it can be used from a phone.

Adding some unit tests would also be a smart move and, while not required, definitely a plus.

> There's **no strict time limit** :hourglass:! Common sense should be the norm here.
